          For this week's assignment I used a dataset containing the nutritional
          information of different cereal. Originally there were roughly 80
          different breands listed so to make data more manageable, I chose the
          most popular brands. This brought me to about 20 different items. I
          then created an object call cereal and added each one into an array
          inside the object. Each array contains the cereal name, number of
          calories, grams of sugar,total number of vitamins, whether the cereal
          is eaten hot or cold and finally an overall health rating based on a
          scale of 1 to 100.
        </p>
        <p>
          currently, you are able to search for the cereal name in a search bar
          on the page. If part of or the entire name matches with a cereal name
          from the object it will display all the info of that cereal in the
          console. If there are multiple cereals that match the entry, all of
          them will be brought up in the console. Unfortunately, I was unable to
          bring up the data on the page itself because the data comes up as
          undefined when I do.
