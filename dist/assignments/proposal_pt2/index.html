          Going deeper into the idea of entertainment systems, I think it would
          be best to start out with something simple and text based. The
          simulation would have a date, time, and current weather. If possible,
          I would like to reuse the weather app from earlier this semester to
          simulate different weather. I believe that this would also add an
          element of randomness as it will be something that is out of the
          user’s control. The simulation will probably start with the app asking
          for the user’s name. Once a name is entered, the user will be asked
          what they want to do for that day. There will be one major task they
          can choose which will be the main task of that day, followed by a
          number of smaller tasks that they can also choose to complete. The
          options will be randomized each day and each task will have different
          effects. For example, if you choose to watch T.V. all day, at some
          point you will probably enter a state of boredom.
        </p>

          I would also like to try having these states have effects that carry
          onto the following day. For example, if you choose to watch T.V. every
          day for a week, it will take time for you to recover and enter the
          default state again. To do this I will most likely have a count for
          each state. When every state is at 0, it will be counted as a “default
          state.” each task will have an effect on specific states, either
          adding to or deducting from that count. Whatever state the user is in
          will also play a role in determining what tasks they will receive for
          the day and also the effect that task will have on the current count.
          These are my current plans for my project, but if time allows, I would
          like to add things like a visual representation of the changes rather
          than text responses.
