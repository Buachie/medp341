          For my final project, one system that I am interested in exploring is
          entertainment. Due to the virus, most people are now finding
          themselves stuck at home with little to do besides work. I would like
          to try making a simulation that revolves around different ways someone
          can entertain themselves at home. I would like to explore the
          different things people can do while at home as well how these
          activities affect us. For example, if someone plays games all day
          instead of studying, they may be entertained, but they most likely
          will not get any smarter. In addition, there may also be some
          activities that you need a certain level of intelligence for so by
          playing games all day, you may be limiting other opportunities. There
          is also the issue of money and interacting with other people. While I
          would like to add on to the initial topic, I mainly want to focus on
          different types of entertainment and how it can affect us.

          One tool that I would like to explore with this project is React. Even
          though I have known about it for years, I never really understood its
          usefulness until very recently. Many of the projects I have completed
          require the page to be refreshed for any major change to take place.
          While this is fine for more static pages where little to no changes
          are being made, for things that are constantly being updated, like my
          cereal rating system from last class, react would make using much
          easier for both the user and the developer in my opinion.

          Personally, I have never really thought of games as simulations.
          However, looking back on many of the games I have played now, most of,
          if not all of them are simulations both simple and complex. Reading
          the article, one example that came to mind is Pokemon. The game can
          basically be boiled down to you choosing an action, and that action
          having a certain effect based on a number of variables like accuracy,
          the type of move, etc. Personally, I think that looking at these games
          as simulations slightly takes away from the entertainment value but I
          also see how looking at games this way makes it much easier to develop
          design.
