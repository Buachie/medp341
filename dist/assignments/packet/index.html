          This week has definitely been interesting in that I have been able to
          see and better understand the process of how we vee websites. I spent
          a lot of my time experimenting with wireshark and trying to better
          understand what all of the information means. The first thing that
          immediately stood out to me was just how much information was being
          processed at the same time. In order to bring all the information down
          to manageable levels, I had to disconnect a lot of my devices from and
          use one tab at a time on my browser.
        </p>

          Another thing I thought was interesting was how information is broken
          down and transferred between different sources based on which route is
          best for each bit of information. Looking into this a little more, I
          found that the main purpose of this is to make the transfer of data
          not only more efficient but more secure. For example, if data
          transfers were directly from the host to the client, if anything were
          to happen to the connection between the two, it would take much longer
          if not be impossible for the user to get that information.

          While I was researching the topic of packets, another thing that came
          up was the issue of packet loss. This is the disruption of packets as
          before they reach their target either causing the information to not
          be read correctly or not be received at all. This is a major cause of
          things like lag when loading a web page or pages only partially
          loading. I found the number of possible causes pretty amazing; ranging
          from simple things like having walls between you and your wifi signal
          to legitimate hardware and network issues that can be extremely hard
          to pinpoint and solve.
