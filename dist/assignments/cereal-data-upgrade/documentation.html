          For this week's assignment I added on to the cereal dataset that I
          created last class. This time, with the help of jquery I was able to
          get the data to display on the DOM. In addition to displaying the
          data, I decided to display an image with text saying whether the
          cereal was "parent approved" or not. I did this by creating a button
          that would display the information in a modal that pops up over the
          page. Clicking the backdrop hides the modal and allows you to check
          another cereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the initial issues I had with this project was dealing with the
          scope of the functions. The function that accesses the data worked but
          when I created a separate function to display that info in the DOM, i
          oculd not access the results of the first function. To fix this, I
          ended up inserting the functions that display the data and the modal
          into the first function that pulls the data from the cereal object.
          Another issue that I was not able to fix was resetting the cereals.
          For example, if you type in one cereal and get a result, if you decide
          to look up another one, the list will not refresh and will continually
          stack with one another.
